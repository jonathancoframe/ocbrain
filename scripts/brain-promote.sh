# brain-promote.sh — turn harvested evidence into servable knowledge, and retire
# knowledge that has stopped earning its place.
#
# brain-sync.sh only records evidence; nothing it does makes a fact retrievable.
# Without a promotion pass the corpus freezes at whatever was last curated by
# hand, and without a retirement pass it only ever grows. This script is the
# other half of the loop:
#
#   1. curate   — compile eligible evidence into wiki facts (hosted model call)
#   2. hygiene  — retire expired and redundant beliefs
#   3. wiki     — rematerialize the wiki, which is also what deletes orphan pages
#   4. lint     — post-condition check on the materialized tree
#   5. vectors  — rebuild the dense sidecar so new facts are semantically findable
#   6. procmine — mine the trajectory corpus (opt-in: OCBRAIN_PROCMINE=1)
#
# NOT installed by default. OCBrain ships no scheduler; an operator opts in by
# loading a launchd agent (see docs/SCHEDULED_MAINTENANCE.md). Step 1 is the only
# one that leaves the machine by default, and it is digest-gated: an unchanged
# corpus makes no API call, so a quiet cycle is free.
